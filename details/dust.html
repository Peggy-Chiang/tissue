  Dust
</mark>
<sub>My studio processes and materials typically involve large amounts of dust. I think I produce more of it than anything of real substance. However light or flighty, I am certain that it is not ephemeral. I am surrounded by the residue of my practice in powdered form. Dust must be one of the hardest things to degrade. The particles are diverse and undiscerning, accepting anyone and anything, the discovery of a new species. Afterimage, halo, aura. The zodiacal light is a false dawn reflected off of cosmic dust.</sub>
<mark> Air </mark>
<sup>The constant hum from the HVAC vent as it circulates air in but not out. In a closed space such as this the air feels stale and heavy. Once by mistake I inhaled a mouthful of sanded dust while trying to blow it off. Breathe out not in. I was sick for weeks. This was before the pandemic and I went to class wearing a face mask, which was still novel to most people I saw.</sup>

<code>There again when I thought Iâ€™d gotten rid of it for good - a constant and persisting presence.</code>
