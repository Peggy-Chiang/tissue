	There is a lot that I dislike about making art, but not enough to outweigh how much I love it. It's a teetering scale, on some days more than others, and that's probably why I still do it. Is this how relationships work? We're social animals so we need each other. It's for survival? I tell my students not to be afraid of failure but I think it's more about giving in to doubt. I am always in doubt but in a good way, so as to not fall into any cynicism of self-depreciation. It's important for me to avoid that, to trust doubt. Let's see how this goes. I'd like to avoid being so easily influenced by others. It's especially hard when I spend a lot of time around someone, I can start talking like them and it often sticks. I feel like I pretend to be someone else when I make work sometimes, so that it is somehow less about me. Doubt leads me to resist translation, undesirable acceptance, the expectations of others, assimilation, all binaries - especially good and evil.
